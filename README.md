# Save-the-world-with-James-Bond
A satellite has gone rogue. A hacker organization has taken control of it and has promised to use it to beam a laser attack on the world. The attack will be carried out on whichever city the satellite will be positioned over every hour from now for the next 13 hours. You and your partner James Bond must determine the trajectory (coordinates) of the satellite for the following 13 hours to help evacuate the city.  What you know are the following:      1. In relation to the satellite, the world is a perfectly round sphere and spins leftward latitudinally. 2. The earth makes a full circle every 24 hrs. 3. The satellite spins longitudinally at the same speed as the earth's rotation. 4. The satellite is currently at position latitude 5 degrees and longitude 5 degrees.  5. Write a program in Python that prints out the positions of the satellite for the next 13 hrs. to help Bond save as many lives as possible. 6. Plot a chart with all of the coordinates you found.
